Getting started

- Fork the https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes repository.
    
- Make a new folder in recipes for your package and name it meta.yml as this 
      https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/3307/files. 
    
- You can Look at the example recipe, read the documentation or refer to the FAQs 
      section for more help.
    
- Open a pull request. Building of your package will be tested on Windows, Mac and Linux.
    
- When your pull request is merged a new repository, called a feedstock, will be created 
      in the github conda-forge organization, and build/upload of your package will automatically 
      be triggered. Once complete, the package is available on conda-forge.
    
- You can update the file i.e. meta.yml if you want a change or update and open another pull 
      request which will act as an update to your current pacakage.
